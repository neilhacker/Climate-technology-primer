            <h1 >1.3: The need for detailed and complex simulations</h1>
            <p>
                Here we're going to try to look at climate effects under different feedback assumptions.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Let’s quickly set the scene in terms of where we are emission wise and what this means. In pre-industrial times CO₂ concentration was around 278 parts per million (ppm) today we are around 408ppm. This increase is what’s causing all of our problems. For context 1ppm is roughly equivalent to 2.13Gt of Carbon or 7.8Gt of CO₂. Because of absorption dynamics it’s not actually enough to remove this amount of CO₂ to drop down a ppm, we would probably have to remove around twice as much, so if we want to drop 1ppm we would have to remove around 15Gt of CO₂.
                <br></br><br></br>
                One approach for ball-parking the feedback effects, outside of complex, many-parameter, simulations, is to look at the past.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I'm going to put below the equation we're working towards, don't worry if it looks like a lot we're going to go through the derivations
                in more detail below:

            Let’s start by just considering the direct adsorption of the outgoing infrared by CO2 itself. 
            From a simple calculation using the radiation balance physics we’ve discussed already the change in 
            temperature for a given amount of radiative forcing is:

            <span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
            ΔF is the radiative forcing from additional greenhouse gasses relative to those in pre-industrial times
            <br></br>
            Tp is the planetary surface temperature prior to additional greenhouse gasses being added ~ 288 Kelvin
            <br></br>
            A ~ 0.3 is the albedo 
            <br></br>
            S is the average solar flux incoming, namely 1/4 of our 1376W/m^2 from above.

            <br></br><br></br>

            If we <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28288%29+%2F+%284*%281-0.3%29+*+1376%2F4%29">plug this in</a> we get the 0.3 Kelvin/Watt/Meter² term from the above formula.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Second, we have to get the <a href="http://acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/radiativeforcing.html">radiative forcing </a> ΔF from the CO2 concentration. 
            The 5.35 Watt per meter squared and the logarithmic dependence comes <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/222.htm">from the IPCC form used here</a>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If we plug this equation <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+0.3+*+5.35++*+Ln%28x%2F278%29+between+278+and+500">into an online plotter</a>, this gives the following curve:

            our current 408 ppm to the above logarithmic formula, we get 0.6K of warming from pre-industrial times, versus around 1K observed in actual reality. This gives us something to compare against but is not the right curve for this relationship in reality. In addition to not including any feedback our model is also neglecting other greenhouse gasses. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <Collapsible trigger="You can expand this section to see some of the feedback effects missing from our model">
            <p>
            One issue is that the absorption of infrared radiation by CO2 is associated with broad spectral bands and sidebands, and at the peaks of those absorption bands, absorption is saturated from the beginning — i.e., essentially every outgoing infrared photon from the surface with a wavelength right in the center one of these peaks will definitely be absorbed by CO2 long before it exits the atmosphere, even at pre-industrial CO2 concentrations — while regions near but not quite at the peaks may become saturated with increasing CO2 concentration. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Another key issue has to do with the height in the atmosphere from which successful radiation out to space occurs, and hence with the temperature at which it occurs — given the Stefan-Boltzmann T^4 dependence of the emitted radiation, and the fact that temperature drops off sharply with height into the atmosphere, the rate of radiation will depend strongly on the height of the source in the atmosphere.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If newly added CO2 effectively absorbs and emits IR radiation from higher in the atmosphere, its contribution to the 
            outflux term of the radiative balance will be smaller, warming the planet, but this dependence needn’t be linear on the 
            CO2 concentration and in fact can be logarithmic. A bit more precisely, adding more CO2 to the atmosphere causes the height 
            at which successful emission into space occurs to move higher, and hence colder, and hence *less*. 
            <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php?a=82&p=7"> It intuitively does</a>,
             which this wonderful <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02695.pdf">paper</a> explains from the perspective of convection in the atmosphere: “the planetary energy balance 
             is not purely radiative but is mediated by convection, with water vapor as the key middleman”.

            <h2>With a historical estimate of feedback</h2>
            <p>
            However, importantly, the formula we just used, which doesn’t take into account any kind of water vapor or biological feedbacks, not to mention many others, <b>underestimates certain longer-timescale historical data</b>, taken from a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5501/112">record</a> that spans over tens of thousands of years, by about a factor of about 4.
            <br></br><br></br>
            As the ACS website puts it:
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
			<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
			<span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
            <br></br><br></br>
            The sensitivity factor this talks about is the term out front of the logarithmic expression for temperature change versus CO2 concentration
			</span> 

            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                our calculated temperature change, that includes only the radiative forcing from increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, accounts for 20-25% of this observed temperature increase. This result implies a climate sensitivity factor <b>perhaps four to five times greater, ∼1.3 K·(W·m–2)–1, than obtained by simply balancing the radiative forcing of the greenhouse gasses</b>. The analysis based only on greenhouse gas forcing has not accounted for <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/forcingandfeedback.html">feedbacks</a> in the planetary system triggered by increasing temperature, including <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/radiativeforcing.html">changes in the structure of the atmosphere</a>.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                So what happens if we put in the missing factor of 4? Then the formula will be:
                <br></br><br></br>
                temperature_increase_from_preindustrial_levels = 4 * [0.3 Kelvin per (Watt per meter squared)] * (5.35 Watt per meter squared) * ln([CO2 concentration in ppm]/278)
                <br></br><br></br>
                This looks like:
                <br></br><br></br>
                <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

                </div>

                <br></br><br></br>
                Then, even at our current ~408 ppm CO2 concentration, we would <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4+*+(0.3+Kelvins+per+(watt+per+meter+squared))+*+(5.35+watts+per+meter+squared)+*+ln(408%2F279)">expect</a> 2.4℃ of warming to ultimately (once the slow feedbacks catch up) occur, relative to pre-industrial times
                <br></br><br></br>
                Now, this is much more warming than has occurred so far. What to make of that? 
                Well, as mentioned above, the water-based feedback phenomena

                <b>can take decades to manifest</b>, so perhaps we should not be surprised that the temperature of the Earth has not yet caught up with where it is going to be heading over the coming decades, even for a hypothetical fixed amount of CO2 from now on, according to this formula. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                A <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013JD020184">recent paper</a> tried to pin down the magnitude of the water feedback based on more recent, rather than long-term historical, observations, including measurements of the water vapor concentration itself. They concluded that the missing feedback factor might be closer to 2, rather than the 4 above.
                <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>

                They do add the caveat that they because of the shortness of their observations, 7 years, there is some inevitable confidence intervals around this value.
                </span> 
                &nbsp;Either of these values still means though that unless the ppm of CO₂ in the atmosphere falls quickly things are not looking good

            Some have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648">argued</a> that a nominal 2C target, given comparatively fast feedbacks like water vapor, actually corresponds to a nearly inexorable push to 3C or higher long-term when slower feedbacks are taken into account.

			</span> 

            Alas, fitting historical or even quite recent data for the “missing feedback factor” isn’t really fully predictive either, even if we had enough of that data, due to abrupt phase transitions or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system">tipping points</a> which can occur at different temperatures. For example, rapid one-time arctic methane release from the permafrost, or ocean albedo decrease brought on by sea ice melting.
            <br></br><br></br>
            To be sure, many seem to disagree that the relevant tipping points are likely to be around 2C, as opposed to higher.

Also, many tipping points would take decades or centuries to manifest their effects, giving time for response, and in some cases in principle for reversal by bringing temperature back down through negative emissions.

            We should probably also worry about nonlinear effects that would depend on the rate of change or the variance of of climate variables. For instance if ecologies can adapt to a given change over long timescales but struggle to do so over short timescales
			</span> 

            But on the more worrisome side, I have seen plenty of papers and analyses that do point to the potential for major tipping points / bi-stabilities around 2℃, or sometimes even less. For example, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252">this paper</a> uses 2℃ as a rough estimate of the temperature that you don’t want to exceed for risk of hitting a potential cascade of major tipping points. Likewise <a href="https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2018/02/the-permafrost-bomb-is-ticking/">this analysis</a> points to potential tipping points in arctic permafrost methane release at even lower temperatures.

            Our climate curves give this equivalence when the feedback factor is around 2.5 (rather than the 4 we initially used).

            There is no reason that the curve with feedback has to be a simple multiple of the curve without feedback, i.e., that 
            there is any simple “missing factor” at all, as opposed to a totally different shape of the dependency. Indeed, in scenarios 
            with large abrupt tipping points this would certainly not be the case. You do, however, get something similar to this 
            description when you linearize simple ordinary differential equation models for the planetary energy balance, by assuming a 
            small perturbation around a given temperature — this is <a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/Lectures/Lecture03%20--%20Climate%20sensitivity%20and%20feedback.html">treated here</a>. The 
            site just linked arrives at a temperature
             perturbation deltaT ~ -R/lambda, where R is the radiative forcing and lambda is a feedback factor that arises from the 
             linearization. In their analysis, they get lambda = −3.3 W m^-2 K^-1 due to just the direct effects of the CO2 forcing and 
             blackbody radiation (called Planck forcing) and lambda = -1.3 W m^-2 K^-1 in a middle of the road IPCC climate sensitivity 
             estimate: I think it is not coincidental here that -3.3/-1.3 ~ 2.5, which is the same as our “missing feedback factor” for 
             the IPCC climate sensitivity estimate just above. In any case, the analysis <a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/Lectures/Lecture03%20--%20Climate%20sensitivity%20and%20feedback.html">here</a> gives a more rigorous definition of feedback 
             factors in linearized models and how to break them down into components due to different causes.)

            With the <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+2*+0.3+*+5.35++*+Ln%28x%2F278%29+between+278+and+540">feedback factor of 2</a> instead of 2.5, we’d cross 1.5C at around 440 ppm, and our remaining carbon budget for 1.5C at the time of writing would therefore be around 2*(440-405 ppm)*7.81=547GtCO2 emitted.

            For comparison, one <a href="https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/sb26/side_events_and_exhibits/application/pdf/070512_ipcc_stott.pdf">figure</a> I’ve seen gives around 0.1C per decade of additional warming even under year 2000 atmospheric CO2 <b>levels kept constant</b>, although <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2013/02/how-big-is-the-climate-change-deficit/">another analysis</a> suggests roughly constant temperature (little further warming) if carbon emissions were to completely and abruptly cease — these are not inconsistent, since if emissions somehow completely ceased, natural carbon sinks could start to kick in to slowly decrease atmospheric CO2, which is not the same as holding CO2 concentrations constant.
            <br></br><br></br>
            It is not obvious to me a priori that some fixed amount of CO2 added to the atmosphere would be naturally removed, on net, at all, even on long timescales… a carbon cycle could in principle keep atmospheric CO2 at a stable level that simply happens to be higher than the pre-industrial concentration. But according to a nice discussion <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25259/chapter/3#33">in the introduction to the NAS report on negative emissions</a>, the sinks are real and active, and indeed once human emissions fall low enough, not even necessarily to zero, the sinks can bring the rate of change of atmospheric CO2 concentration to net negative:

            </p>
            <blockquote>
				<p>
                To reduce atmospheric CO2 from 450 to 400 ppm, it would not be necessary to create net negative anthropogenic emissions equal to the net positive historical emissions that caused the concentration to increase from 400 to 450 ppm. The persistent disequilibrium uptake by the land and ocean carbon sinks would allow for achievement of this reduction even with net positive anthropogenic emissions during the 50 ppm decline.

			<br></br><br></br>
            Even some of the scenarios that target 1.5C set that as an ultimate target for the end of the century, and actually slightly <a href="https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1174955265679953921">exceed</a> that target between now and then, relying on negative emissions to bring it down afterwards. 
            This <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeriRogelj/status/1174736029678542849">recen t</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1541-4.epdf">Nature </a> paper though explains the dangers of thinking this way
            </span> 

            Anyway, loosely speaking,from what I’ve understood, in the absence of large-scale deployment of negative emissions technology, it seems unlikely that we have more than 10 years of emissions at current levels while still having a high likelihood of not exceeding a 1.5C peak warming, given what we know now. That’s ~400 GigaTonnes CO2 for the 10 years, versus a budget of roughly zero for a feedback factor of 2.5 and roughly 550GtCO2 for a feedback factor of 2 as estimated above. <b>There is a chance we’ve already committed to 1.5C peak warming, in the absence of large-scale negative emissions, regardless of what else we do</b>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            With all that in mind, here are two snippets from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf">IPCC report</a> on 1.5C (written over a year ago so the carbon budget is roughly 40-80 GtCO2 less now). The left hand snippet expresses the level of uncertainty in the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C, and the right snippet mentions the need for negative emissions in real-world scenarios where we stabilize to 1.5C. Their 420-580 GtCO2 budget from a year or so ago accords decently well with what we got (zero to 550 GtCO2) from the feedback factor of 2-2.5 case above.

            Again, subject to all the caveats about the notion of carbon budgets here, not to mention our crappiest of models.
            <br></br><br></br>
            At the time of writing, meanwhile, this calculator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2017/jan/19/carbon-countdown-clock-how-much-of-the-worlds-carbon-budget-have-we-spent">from the Guardian</a>, gives 687 GigaTonnes, or 17 years at our current emissions rate
			</span> 

            We can also ballpark a remaining carbon budget for 2C warming using the 450 ppm ~ 2C idea. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            [NOTE THIS SHOULD BE STRUCTURED BETTER]
            450 ppm ~ 3514 GigaTonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere, 
            versus ~3163 (405 ppm) up there now, 
            so we would be allowed to add around 300 or 350 more. 
            So if the oceans and land plants absorb 1/2 of what we emit (bad for ocean acidification), 
            the maximum carbon budget for 2C in this very particular scenario is around 2*(3514-3163) GigaTonnes CO2 
            = 702 GigaTonnes of emitted CO2 if there are no negative emissions. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <span className="marginnote-reactive" id="480ppm">
            2*(480-405 ppm)*7.81 GtCO2/ppm = 1171 GtCO2, 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Or if we use 530 ppm as our 2C target we get 2*(530-405)*7.81=1953 GtCO2
            </span> 
             
            Now, the carbon budgets I’m seeing in the IPCC <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf">reports</a> for 2℃ seem a bit higher, in the range of 1200-2000 GigaTonnes, which we can get if we use  <b onClick={()=>sidebar('480ppm')} style={{cursor: 'pointer'}}>480 ppm</b> as our target for 2C instead of 450 ppm.
