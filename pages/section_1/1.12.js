            <h1> 1.12: Tentative conclusions</h1>
            <p>
            My sense — again, as an outsider to the field simply trying to grok the literature in my free time — is that we should do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure our ability to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02846-4">measure</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/science-insurgents-plot-climate-model-driven-artificial-intelligence">model</a> everything in the climate system continues to improve, including for complex land and ocean biological effects.</li>
                <li>Lobby for a revenue-neutral, staged price on carbon, in rich countries initially — rich countries can bring down the cost for poor countries by developing and scaling up better, cheaper technology. In the USA there is a specific program with some high-profile advocates called the <a href="https://www.clcouncil.org/our-plan/">Carbon Dividends Plan</a>. I certainly don’t want to say that a carbon tax is the only necessary policy though — also advanced R&D, <a href="https://rhg.com/research/can-tax-credits-tackle-climate/?stream=top">tax credits</a>, subsidies, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/climate-action-lobby-groups-greta-thunberg-1461292">lobbying</a> <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/jan/17/how-money-corrupts-congress-and-plan-stop-it/">reform</a>, and down the line hopefully <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/glen-weyl-radically-reforming-capitalism-and-democracy/">new social technology</a> for making societal decisions would come into play.</li>
                <li>Economically incentivize a full transition to <a href="https://www.cicero.oslo.no/en/posts/climate-news/stylised-pathways-to-well-below-2c">net-negative emissions by around 2050</a>. This includes deploying a portfolio of existing clean technologies now to limit our cumulative carbon emissions and peak CO2 concentration.</li>
                <li>Heavily invest in large-scale, <a href="http://newmaeweb.ucsd.edu/courses/MAE119/WI_2018/ewExternalFiles/Hoffert%20et%20al%20%282002%29%20Advanced%20Technology%20Paths%20to%20Global%20Cl.pdf">advanced R&D</a> to bring down the cost of grid-scale energy storage, next-generation nuclear, novel clean manufacturing processes for things like <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-question-to-ask-about-every-climate-plan\">steel and cement</a>, improved agricultural technologies, smart grid-integrated buildings, and <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/burgerking/">synthetic meat</a> (among other areas). With enough technological innovation, I hope that the cost to decarbonize could be brought lower than the estimates of those like Nordhaus.</li>
                <li>Switch to <a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/c20/page_131.shtml">electric cars</a>. (This will impact multiple key areas.)</li>
            </ul>
